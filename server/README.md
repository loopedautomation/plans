# The workspace server

A workspace is a folder of markdown files several people edit at once, with
cursors and presence, hosted rather than backed by a repository. Files and
folders are created, renamed, moved and deleted as on disk, and every change
lands for everyone as it happens. When an argument settles, the plan leaves the
folder — copied into a local repository from the app — and everything
downstream works exactly as it does for any other file. The workspace is
upstream of the file world, not a replacement for it. The reasoning is in
[`plans/hosted-workspaces.md`](../plans/hosted-workspaces.md) and
[`plans/workspace-folders/`](../plans/workspace-folders).

This is the folder. One Node process, one Postgres database, one websocket per
open document. Nothing here is a queue, a second database, or a framework, and
the moment it wants one the scope has slipped.

## Rooms, trees and files

A room is one Yjs document, and a workspace is made of several:

- **The tree** is the room whose id *is* the workspace's id. It holds a map of
  path → `{ kind: "file" | "folder", doc: <id> }`, so create, rename, move and
  delete are transactions on a map everyone is looking at, and two people
  acting at once merge rather than fight. A rename is a move of the key: the
  document id does not change, so anyone with the file open carries on editing
  the same document under its new name.
- **Each file** is a room of its own, keyed by the document id the tree gives
  it. Its `meta.markdown` is whatever the last editing client serialised, which
  is what the read endpoint and the share viewer answer with — the server needs
  no editor schema to serve a file.

Which workspace a document belongs to is what authorises the socket, and it
comes from the `docs` table. A file made a moment ago has no row there — its
id is minted by whoever created it, because a round trip in the middle of a
tree transaction would be a file that exists for one person before it exists
for anyone — so the socket carries `?workspace=<id>` and membership of that
workspace is what lets it in. A document that *does* have a row is judged by
that row, so naming your own workspace cannot reach anyone else's document.

Every workspace has a `plan.md`. A new one is created with it; a workspace
made before folders keeps its one document under that name, so the read
endpoint and every share link minted back then carry on answering.

It also serves the public reader — the app's own read-only build — at `/` and
`/{id}`, so a plan can be shared with someone who has no account. That is one
static folder and one table, not a second program; see
[`plans/public-plan-pages.md`](../plans/public-plan-pages.md).

## Running it

```sh
node server/src/index.js
```

| Variable               | Default          | What it is                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`                 | `8787`           |                                                                                     |
| `HOST`                 | `127.0.0.1`      | `0.0.0.0` in the container, behind whatever terminates TLS.                          |
| `DATABASE_URL`         | —                | Postgres. Unset, the server runs an in-process Postgres (PGlite): a laptop, a test.   |
| `AUTH0_DOMAIN`         | —                | The looped Auth0 tenant, e.g. `looped.eu.auth0.com`. Without it, sign-in is off.     |
| `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`      | —                | The tenant's *native* application for Plans, with the Device Code grant enabled.     |
| `WORKSPACES_DEV_LOGIN` | —                | `1` enables `POST /auth/dev`, a session for a bare login. Tests and laptops only.     |

The app learns where this server is at build time, from `VITE_WORKSPACE_URL`
(the release workflow reads it from the repository variable `WORKSPACE_URL`).
A build made without it shows no workspaces at all. On a laptop, point a dev
build at a local server with `VITE_WORKSPACE_URL=http://localhost:8787 pnpm dev`.

Node 22 or newer. The database driver is `pg`. The tables are drizzle's:
`src/schema.js` is their shape, `drizzle/` holds the SQL that drizzle-kit
generated from it, and the server applies that folder on start — under an
advisory lock, so two replicas starting together take turns — before it
listens. The ledger is `drizzle.plans_migrations`, the looped apps' shape.
An empty database is a valid one.

To change a table: edit `src/schema.js`, run
`pnpm --filter plans-workspaces db:generate`, and commit the new file under
`drizzle/`. Never edit a generated file, and never edit the schema without
generating: the ledger records what has been applied, and a hand-made change
is one it does not know about.

### The database

Its own database on the looped Postgres server, not a schema in `looped`:
nothing here joins anything of looped's, and a workspace document is a blob
the other apps have no reason to see.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE plans OWNER <the role the other looped apps connect as>;
```

Then `DATABASE_URL` is the looped connection string with `/plans` as the
database. The tables are created on first start.

### Secrets: Infisical

The server's secrets live in the looped Infisical project, under
`/apps/plans` (with `/shared` merged before it: in this CLI the later path
wins a name both folders hold, and `/shared` holds the web apps'
`AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`). `server/.infisical.json` names the project, so on a laptop:

```sh
pnpm --filter plans-workspaces dev      # infisical run … -- node src/index.js
```

What goes in the folder, per environment:

| Secret             | dev                          | prod                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`     | leave unset for PGlite, or a local Postgres | the `plans` database above |
| `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` | the tenant and its native application for Plans | the same, or shared from `/shared` |

### The container

```sh
docker build -f server/Dockerfile -t plans-workspaces .
docker run --rm -p 8787:8787 plans-workspaces          # in-process database, no sign-in
```

`.github/workflows/server-image.yml` publishes
`ghcr.io/loopedautomation/plans-workspaces` on every push to `main` that touches
the server (`:main`, `:sha-…`) and on `server-vX.Y.Z` tags. Point a Coolify
application at that image and give it the same environment the looped
services get:

| Variable                                        | Value                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `INFISICAL_CLIENT_ID`, `INFISICAL_CLIENT_SECRET` | a machine identity with read on `/shared` and `/apps/plans` |
| `INFISICAL_PROJECT_ID`                          | `85f068d3-bcfe-4e1e-90e0-97845cf7058c`               |
| `INFISICAL_API_URL`                             | `https://infisical.looped.sh`                        |
| `INFISICAL_ENV`                                 | `prod` (the default)                                 |

The entrypoint exchanges the identity for a token and wraps the process in
`infisical run`; with no Infisical variables it starts unchanged, which is
what `docker run` above does.

**Sign-in is Auth0's device flow**, against the tenant the other looped apps
use, so a workspace member is the identity they already have. It needs a
*Native* application in the tenant with the *Device Code* grant enabled and
`openid profile email` in its allowed scopes; no callback URL, because the
desktop app has nowhere to be sent back to. The app shows a code, the
person confirms it in a browser, and this server does the polling. What the
tenant hands back is an ID token; the server verifies it against the
tenant's signing keys, reads the email, and mints a session of its own. The
client id is not a secret, but it lives here rather than in the app so that
changing it does not mean shipping a build.

People are known by email, lowercased: it is what an invite names before
its subject has ever signed in.

## What it holds

Users by email; sessions, as hashed tokens; workspaces and their members (by
email, so an invite can precede the invitee's first sign-in); the read token
and any share links, hashed, each link naming a file; and every document as a
Yjs update blob in `docs`, keyed by its own id and carrying the workspace it
belongs to and whether it is that workspace's tree or one of its files.

There is no review state. A workspace used to hold one — requested, approved,
changes, with the rule that the author could not approve their own plan — and
it has been retired: `status:` in a file's frontmatter and `approved` as a
human's word say what the gate said, and they travel with the file into the
repository instead of staying behind on a server. The columns are dropped on
start, as is the old one-document-per-workspace shape of `docs`.

## The two halves of the port

Everything the app talks to is under `/api`. The root belongs to the reader:
`/` and `/{id}` serve public plan pages out of `public/`, which is the app's
own read-only build. The one exception is `/share`, the redirect that keeps
links minted before pages existed working.

| Route          | What it does                                                                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /`        | The reader. With no id in the address it says so; there is no index of pages.     |
| `GET /{id}`    | A published plan. The id is the whole of the secret — no session, no token.       |
| `GET /{id}/…`  | One file of a shared folder, in the same reader.                                   |
| `GET /assets/…`| The reader's bundle, content-hashed and cached for a year.                        |
| `GET /share`   | A shim: reads the old link's token from `location.hash` and leaves for its page.  |
| `GET /health`  | `{ ok: true }`, also at `/api/health`.                                            |

`public/` is not in the repository. `pnpm build:share` writes it (that is
`vite build --mode share`), and the image builds it in a stage of its own, so
the page and the editor can never be two versions of the same renderer.
Without it the server still answers the API and says `503` at the reader's
addresses rather than pretending the plan is not shared.

## The API

Every call is JSON, and every call that needs a person carries
`Authorization: Bearer <session>`. Paths below are relative to `/api`; the
handful the app used to call at the root still answer there, for builds that
predate the move.

| Route                                | What it does                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `POST /auth/device`                  | Start Auth0's device flow: a code, and the page that confirms it.                           |
| `POST /auth/device/poll`             | `{ deviceCode }` → `{ pending: true }` until they have, then `{ token, user }`.               |
| `POST /auth/signout`                 | End the session.                                                                             |
| `GET /me`                            | Who the token belongs to.                                                                    |
| `GET /workspaces`                    | The workspaces you belong to.                                                                |
| `POST /workspaces`                   | `{ name }` → a new workspace with you in it.                                                 |
| `GET /workspaces/:id`                | One workspace: its name and members.                                                          |
| `POST /workspaces/:id/members`       | `{ login }` → invite by email.                                                                |
| `GET /workspaces/:id/tree`           | The tree, for a cold open: `[{ path, kind, doc, status }]`.                                   |
| `POST /workspaces/:id/token`         | Mint a read token for this workspace, for the factory's secrets.                             |
| `GET /w/:id/`                        | The folder: `{ name, files: [{ path, kind }] }`.                                              |
| `GET /w/:id/<path>`                  | One file as markdown — for a member's session or the workspace's read token.                  |
| `GET /pages/:id`                     | A published plan, to anyone: `{ id, kind: "file", name, source, live, publishedAt, markdown }`. A folder page answers `{ kind: "folder", name, prefix, files, landing }`. No auth. |
| `GET /pages/:id.md`                  | The same plan as markdown; a folder's landing file.                                           |
| `GET /pages/:id/<path>`              | One file of a folder page as markdown, if `<path>` is under the prefix; `404` otherwise.       |
| `POST /pages`                        | Publish or republish. `{ workspaceId, path }` — a `path` ending in `/` names a folder, `/` the whole workspace — or `{ repo, path, name, markdown }`, or `{ id, … }`. |
| `DELETE /pages/:id`                  | Stop sharing. The publisher, or any member of the page's workspace.                          |
| `GET /workspaces/:id/page`           | Whether this document is published, for a member. A file under a live folder share answers with the folder's page and `covers`, its path on it. Not a listing of anyone's pages. |
| `POST /share/resolve`                | `{ token }` → `{ id }`: an old share link, traded for its document's page.                     |
| `WS /api/ws/:id?token=<session>&workspace=<id>` | One live document — a tree or a file: y-websocket's sync and awareness messages.       |

A workspace you are not a member of answers `404`, never `403`: a stranger
learns nothing, not even that the id exists. A share token that was revoked,
that has expired, or that was never minted here answers the same way, and so
does a page whose sharing was stopped.

### Published pages

A page is a plan at an address anyone can open: `https://<server>/{id}`, where
the id is twenty-four random bytes and the whole of the security. A page
nobody has the URL for is unreachable; a URL that leaks is answered by
stopping the share, which is a timestamp rather than a delete, so the dead
address stays dead. There is no session, no fragment and no token — a public
page is public, and its address is what is shared.

A page can name a folder. Its `path` is a prefix ending in `/` — `/` for the
whole workspace — and everything under that prefix is readable at
`/{id}/{path}`: one id, one Stop, and a relative link between two files in
the folder is a link that works. `GET /api/pages/{id}` answers the folder
(its files relative to the prefix, and which one a reader lands on: a
`README.md`, then `plan.md`, then the first in tree order);
`GET /api/pages/{id}/{path}` answers one file's markdown, and only under the
prefix — outside it is the same `404` a stopped page gets, because a page id
must never be a way to read what was not shared. Both read the room, so the
folder follows the workspace as files are added and renamed. The reader
serves `/{id}/{path}` as the same shell, so a deep link lands on its file.

The source is one of two shapes. A workspace document's page keeps no copy:
it reads the room, and there is only ever one live page per workspace, so
publishing twice hands back the address a member already gave out. A
repository file's page is a copy, pushed by the app on every save while
sharing is on. Both are read by the same document, at the same address, and
the reader is not told which it is looking at beyond whether it is `live`.
The reasoning is in
[`plans/public-plan-pages.md`](../plans/public-plan-pages.md).

### Share links

Superseded by pages, and kept only so links already in circulation keep
working: `/share#<token>` resolves the token to its document's page and
redirects there. The app mints no new ones.

A share link is `https://<server>/share#<token>`. Browsers never send the
fragment, so the access log, any proxy and any unfurler see `/share` and get a
static shell with nothing in it; the shim's script reads `location.hash` and
posts it to `/api/share/resolve`, which publishes the document's page if
nobody had and answers with its id. The token is the address — the workspace
id is never in the URL.

Share tokens are their own table rather than a flag on `read_tokens`, because
the two have different lives: the factory's read token is minted once and lives
in secrets, share links are minted casually and revoked on a whim, and the list
one UI shows should never have the other in it. Both are stored hashed;
revoking is a timestamp, not a delete. A share link also expires thirty days
after minting — revocation answers the leaked link, expiry answers the
forgotten one — and an expired link is indistinguishable from a revoked one
from outside. The reasoning is in
[`plans/sharable-links.md`](../plans/sharable-links.md).

`server/src/share.html` is all that is left of the old viewer: a page that
resolves a token and leaves. It used to render the document itself, which was
a second renderer with its own idea of a table and no mermaid at all — and
that is exactly what the reader replaced.

## Tests

```sh
pnpm --filter plans-workspaces test
```

Real HTTP and a real websocket against an in-process Postgres, so the suite
needs nothing installed. The tenant is stubbed only in the tests that are
about the device flow, with a real RS256 key so verification is exercised.
