# Looped Plans

**A small desktop app for reading and editing the markdown in your local git
repositories** — without opening the whole repo in an editor.

**[Download](https://github.com/loopedautomation/plans/releases/latest)** for macOS, Windows or Linux · free and open source

The files it shows are usually written by something else: Claude Code in a
terminal, an agent, a script. So the app is built to be a good way to *live
with* that output — read it, review the diff, adjust it, commit it — rather
than a general-purpose markdown editor.

## Installing on Linux

**Arch, Omarchy included.** The `PKGBUILD` builds a normal pacman package out
of the release's `.deb` payload, so pacman owns the files and removing it is
`pacman -R looped-plans-bin`:

```sh
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loopedautomation/plans/main/packaging/aur/PKGBUILD
makepkg -si
```

The same two lines are the update: the `PKGBUILD` on `main` names the current
release, so re-running them after a new one installs it over the old. There is
no AUR package yet, and the app does not update itself on Linux — a copy under
`/usr/bin` is the package manager's to replace, and it knows not to ask.

**Debian and Ubuntu.** Take the `.deb` from the release and install it:

```sh
sudo apt install ./Looped.Plans_*_amd64.deb
```

**Anything else.** The AppImage runs without installing: `chmod +x` it and go.

## What it does

- **Every markdown file, in every open repo.** Add any local git repository;
  the app remembers them between launches and shows them all at once, at the top
  level of one tree. `.git`, `node_modules`, `target` and the usual build
  directories are skipped, and gitignored files are hidden until you ask for
  them.
- **Nothing is locked, and nothing is lost.** The file on disk is the only
  buffer. Every save is conditional on a fingerprint taken when the file was
  read: if something else wrote it first the write is refused, your edit is kept,
  and you are asked whether to keep yours or take theirs. A file that changes
  while you have it open and clean simply reloads.
- **Autosave on your terms.** After a pause (2s by default, adjustable), when the
  window loses focus, or only on `⌘S`. Switching files or quitting always
  flushes what is pending.
- **Three ways to look at a file.** `⌘1` the page, `⌘2` the raw markdown, `⌘3`
  the diff against the last commit. All three are editable and all three are the
  same buffer, so a change in one is a change in the others.
- **WYSIWYG that keeps the file intact.** [Milkdown Crepe](https://milkdown.dev)
  renders the document as rich text while the file stays plain markdown.
  The round trip is byte-for-byte: bullets stay `-`, text is not escaped, and the
  trailing newline and frontmatter block are preserved exactly. Opening a file
  does not count as editing it.
- **The HTML in your markdown renders.** Local images are read from the
  repository, `<picture>` picks its source from the paper you are using rather
  than from the system appearance, and wrapper tags like `<div align="center">`
  or `<sub>` do what they say. Double-click any of it to edit the source.
  Comments become a margin note. Mermaid blocks draw a diagram under their source.
- **Full git panel.** Branch switcher, pull/push with ahead/behind counts,
  per-file diffs, stage/unstage, undo a change, and commit (`⌘⏎` in the message
  box). It acts on markdown only, and says how much else in the repo it is
  leaving alone.
- **Command palette.** `⌘P` for files across every open repo, `⌘⇧P` for commands
  — every setting, and git: branch, pull, push, fetch, commit, switch — and
  `?` to search *inside* files, which is the question notes usually pose.
- **New files come from templates you own.** A template is a markdown file in
  `~/.plans/templates/`: its frontmatter says what it is called, what to call
  the file (`{slug}`, `{title}`, `{date:yyyy-MM-dd}`) and what frontmatter to
  start it with; its body is the body. Two ship — a plan and a blank daily note
  named for today — and the folder is yours after that, so editing or deleting
  one sticks. The palette carries a "New: …" per template, `⌘N` is the first,
  and a filename the calendar answers skips the naming sheet entirely.
- **Files stay where you put them.** New file asks which repository and folder;
  renaming edits the name, moving picks a folder — two questions, two answers,
  and a tab that follows its file through either. Dragging a file or a folder
  onto another folder moves it. A pasted or dropped image is written beside the document in
  `assets/` and linked relatively, never inlined as a data URL.
- **Three papers.** Day, Sepia, and Night, in the manner of an e-reader. Colour
  discipline throughout: chrome is ink at varying opacity, and colour means "this
  differs from what's committed" — with two deliberate exceptions, code blocks
  and diffs, where hue is doing real work. Each paper carries its own syntax
  palette.
- **Five typefaces**, plus five monospaced faces for the chrome and code.
  Open-source families from [Open Foundry](https://open-foundry.com): Vollkorn
  (Friedrich Althausen), Libre Baskerville (Impallari Type), Work Sans (Wei
  Huang), Karla (Jonny Pinhorn), Space Mono (Colophon Foundry). All SIL OFL,
  vendored into `src/fonts/` so the app needs no network; re-fetch with
  `pnpm fonts`.
- **Picks up outside edits.** File lists and git status re-poll every 4s, and the
  open file is watched separately, so work done in a terminal turns up without a
  restart.

Git operations shell out to your system `git`, so your existing credentials,
SSH keys, commit signing, and hooks all apply.

## Tests

```sh
pnpm test          # behaviour and performance, in a real browser
pnpm test:ui       # the same, watchable
cd src-tauri && cargo test
```

`tauri-driver` has no macOS support, so the packaged app cannot be driven.
It matters less than it sounds: every failure this project has had lived in the
frontend or at the IPC boundary, and `e2e/fake-backend.ts` answers every Rust
command in memory — so a test can rewrite a file mid-edit to provoke a conflict,
or assert exactly which writes the app issued.

`e2e/perf.spec.ts` holds budgets rather than benchmarks. Every slowdown here has
been a regression — a hidden editor reparsing on each keystroke, a plugin
dispatching from its own update hook, four repositories walked at once behind
someone's typing — invisible until measured. The budgets fail when a change
makes the app worse and stay quiet otherwise.

## Releasing

Every change carries its own note, written when the change is made:

```sh
pnpm changeset     # a bump level and a sentence, committed with the change
pnpm run version   # collects them: bumps every version, writes CHANGELOG.md
```

Cutting a release is then a tag. The build signs, notarizes, and attaches both
the `.dmg` and the updater's `.app.tar.gz` to a **draft** release; publishing it
is what makes an installed copy see it. Installed copies check GitHub on their
own and offer the update in a banner — never a modal, and never without a press.
[`RELEASES.md`](RELEASES.md) has the whole routine.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 20+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) (stable)
- `git` on your `PATH`

## Running

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev         # the app, with hot reload
pnpm web         # only the web half, in a browser
pnpm app:build   # produces a bundled .app / installer under src-tauri/target/release/bundle
```

## Notes

- File paths from the UI are resolved inside the selected repository only; `..`
  and absolute paths are rejected in the Rust layer.
- HTML is sanitised before rendering — no scripts, no frames, no event handlers.
  These files are written by agents, and opening one should never run anything.
- Forgetting a repository removes it from the app only; nothing on disk is
  touched. Deleting a file does delete it.
- `Pull` uses `--ff-only`, so a diverged branch fails loudly instead of
  auto-merging behind your back.
- Settings live in `settings.json` in the platform's config directory, with a
  generated `settings.schema.json` beside it. Open it from Settings or the
  palette; edits made outside are picked up on the watch interval, and a file
  that does not parse keeps the last good settings rather than resetting them.
  `localStorage` still holds a copy, but only as a warm start for the first
  frame — the file is what counts.
