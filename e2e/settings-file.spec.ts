/**
 * Settings as a file.
 *
 * The app's thesis is that plain files people and agents can both read beat
 * opaque state, and the settings were the one piece of its own state arguing
 * the opposite. They now live in settings.json, with localStorage kept on as a
 * warm start so the theme is right on the first frame.
 *
 * That arrangement has exactly four ways to be wrong, and each is a test here:
 * the file never gets written on first launch, the cache wins a disagreement
 * it should lose, an edit made outside never arrives, or a typo silently
 * resets everything someone spent an afternoon choosing.
