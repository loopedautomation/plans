## Problem

An agent runs in a working directory, and a workspace file has none: the
chat in a workspace was starting the agent with the memory buffer's
placeholder as its directory, and now does not start at all. The mirror plan
(`workspace-mirror.md`) answers this with git, which is right for the
factory but a long way round for a conversation about the file on screen.

## Approach

The protocol already routes an agent's file reads and writes through the
client when the client says it can: the app advertises those capabilities
today. So the app can be the workspace's filesystem, with a scratch folder
for the parts of an agent that want a real path.

- **A scratch checkout per workspace.** Opening the chat in a workspace
  writes the room's tree into a folder under `~/plans/workspaces`,
  keyed by workspace id, and starts the agent with that folder as its
  working directory. Listing, grepping and shell tools work, because the
  files are really there.
- **Reads answer from the room, writes go to it.** The client-side handlers
  for `fs/read_text_file` and `fs/write_text_file` — today they touch disk —
  learn the scratch folder: a read inside it answers with the room's current
  text, and a write inside it becomes an edit to the room's document, then
  a refreshed file. The room stays the truth; the folder is a cache the
  agent is allowed to believe in.
- **An edit to a file nobody has open** needs markdown turned into a
  document edit, which is what the write editor does for an open file. The
  app mounts a hidden editor bound to that file's room for as long as an
  agent is writing to it, and lets it go afterwards. Same machinery, no
  surface.
- **The folder follows the room.** A change from anyone lands in the folder
  on the same debounce that publishes `meta.markdown`, so the agent's next
  read is current. New files and renames in the tree are files and renames
  in the folder.
- **Status is just a write.** An agent setting `status: done` in a file's
  frontmatter is an edit like any other; the tree's dot follows.

## Implementation guide

- [x] `src-tauri/src/agent/client.rs` - the read and write handlers check
      whether the path is under a registered scratch folder, and if so ask
      the frontend (an event with a reply) rather than the disk
- [x] `src-tauri/src/agent/mod.rs` - `agent_prompt` accepts a scratch
      folder to start in; a command materialises and refreshes the folder
      from text the frontend hands it
- [x] `src/workspace.ts` - a `scratch(id)` that writes the tree to the
      folder and keeps it current while a chat is open
- [x] `src/App.tsx` - the chat is offered in a workspace again, against the
      scratch folder; writes arriving from the agent go to the open editor,
      or to a hidden one mounted for the purpose
- [x] `src/Editor.tsx` - a headless mode: bound to a room, no host in the
      layout, one `replace` and gone
- [x] `e2e/workspace.spec.ts` - an agent's write to a workspace file
      appears in the other person's editor; a read answers with what they
      typed a moment ago

### What landed, and where it differs from the guide

- The app did not advertise the `fs` capability before this; the session
  only offered form elicitation, so there were no read and write handlers to
  teach. `session.rs` now advertises `fs.readTextFile` and
  `fs.writeTextFile`, and `client.rs` gained both handlers: the disk for a
  repository, the frontend (an `agent-fs` event answered by
  `agent_fs_reply`) for a path under a registered scratch folder. Outstanding
  reads and writes are refused when a session stops or a turn is cancelled,
  the way permissions are.
- `agent_prompt` did not change. Its `repo` was always the working
  directory, so the chat in a workspace hands it the folder that
  `workspace_scratch` answered with, and that folder is also the key the
  workspace's conversations are stored under. The new commands are
  `workspace_scratch(id, files)` and `workspace_scratch_forget(id)`, in
  `src-tauri/src/agent/scratch.rs`.
- The folder is written whole on every change, from every file's room. That
  means the app opens a room for each file in the workspace while a chat is
  wanted there, including files nobody has on screen; the cost is one
  socket per file, which is fine at the sizes workspaces are today.
- A write from the agent replaces the whole document (`replaceAll`), as the
  Source view does. The open question about diffing against the room's text
  to keep other people's cursors in place is still open.

## Out of scope

The factory. It dispatches from git, and needs the mirror. Two agents in
one workspace at once, which the scratch folder per workspace would have to
become a folder per chat to support.

## Open questions

- Does the adapter route *every* read through the client, or only the
  agent's own Read tool? A shell `cat` reads the folder, which is a cache —
  fresh on the debounce, but not the room itself.
- A write that arrives while someone is mid-word in the same paragraph:
  Yjs merges, but the agent's whole-document write is a large edit. Diffing
  the agent's text against the room's and applying only the change would
  keep other cursors where they are.
