/**
 * Sharing a plan: one address, on or off.

 * and its own Revoke — was a management page for a capability. A published
 * plan is simpler and says more: there is one page, its URL is the whole of
 * the secret, and the thing that undoes it is "Stop sharing". While it is on
 * the page follows the file, so what a reader sees is what the author last
 * saved. The reasoning is in plans/public-plan-pages.md.
