/**
 * Rendering the HTML that markdown files contain.

 * Milkdown keeps HTML as an atom node whose DOM is the raw source text, so a
 * `<picture>` block or an `<!-- aside -->` shows up as literal characters in
 * the middle of the prose. This replaces that view with two behaviours:
 *
 *   - comments become a quiet margin marker that opens the comment on click;
 *   - everything else is rendered, with relative image paths resolved against
 *     the repository so a README cover actually appears.
 *
 * The markdown itself is untouched either way — the node still serialises back
 * to exactly the source it came from.
